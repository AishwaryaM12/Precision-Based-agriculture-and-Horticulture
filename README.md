# Precision Based Agriculture and Horticulture
Precision based agriculture is an application for efficient farming. Using machine learning algorithms we can make an assumption of adequate amout of irriagtion water needed, feritilzer type and amount for soil, crop production per land area using some inputs. Using these output amounts we can make a guidance providing application for better agricuture and horticulture.

You can see this application live at https://precfarm.herokuapp.com/.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
Make sure that you have python pre-installed on your PC.
Things you need to install the software and how to install them: <br />
flask   <br />
sklearn  <br />
pickle-mixin  <br />
numpy  <br />

```
pip install flask
pip install sklearn
pip install pickle-mixin
pip install numpy

```
### Installing
A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running:
1) Clone this Github repository on your local env or PC.
2) Open the folder where app.js file is located.
3) Open terminal and cd to the folder where app.js is located.
4) Open app.js and rewrite process.env.PORT to a port number e.g. 4000 and save the file.
5) Run app.js in the terminal and you can see the project live at localhost:4000 or your above decided port number.
6) Open precision farming backend folder where app.py file is located and run python app.py.
7) Now move back to the browser and app has started with full functionality.

## Deployment

If you wish to deploy this project on heroku dont make any installion changes you will need a Procfile,requirements.txt, packahe.json file all are available in this repository.Best WishesðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒ.
